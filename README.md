# dcs-client

Client-side libraries for connecting your website or web app to the
[Docuss](https://github.com/sylque/docuss) plugin.

## Libraries

- `comToPlugin.js`: low-level library for web apps. Allows to establish a direct
  link with the Docuss plugin.
- `dcs-html-based.js`: intermediate-level library for static websites. Requires
  that you add specific HTML markup to each page.
- `dcs-decorator.js`: high-level library for static websites. HTML markup is
  dynamically added based on rules contained in a JSON file.
